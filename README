    ============
    INSTALLATION
    ============

$ sudo dnf install 'pkgconfig(purple)' 'pkgconfig(libsoup-2.4)' 'pkgconfig(json-glib-1.0)'
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Given the rate of development, you may find it easier to make a symbolic
link from the installed plugin (e.g. /usr/lib64/purple-2/libchimeprpl.so) to
.libs/libchimeprpl.so in your working tree.


    ==============
    AUTHENTICATION
    ==============

This plugin is capable of obtaining the session token by emulating a web
browser and following the login process.  Currently, it is possible to
log in with your corporate credentials (Active Directory) as well as
with your Amazon credentials.

During this process, user input may be required (user and password, or
just password).  Make sure you are using a libpurple application that
properly implements interactive user input.

Passwords will NOT be stored anywhere.  Passwords are only necessary to
obtain a session token, and new session tokens are obtained with the
previous one.  If the token gets lost or corrupted, the login process
will be triggered again to obtain a new token.

In case all this stops working, the session token can be obtained with a
web browser; but first report this situation.  Start at
https://signin.id.ue1.app.chime.aws/ and complete the authentication
process until you end up at a URI that the browser cannot handle, which
looks something like

      chime://sso_sessions?Token=eyJyZâ€¦

The part after 'Token=' is your authentication token. Create an account
in Pidgin, select 'Amazon Chime' as the protocol in the 'Basic' tab then
go to the 'Advanced' tab and paste the token in the 'Token' field. Leave
the 'Signin URL' field empty.


    =========
