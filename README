Pidgin plugin for Amazon Chime
==============================


    =======
    SUPPORT
    =======

This plugin is not supported by the Amazon Chime team. Do not contact
them for any assistance with this client.


    ============
    INSTALLATION
    ============

$ sudo dnf install 'pkgconfig(purple)' 'pkgconfig(libsoup-2.4)' 'pkgconfig(json-glib-1.0)'
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Given the rate of development, you may find it easier to make a symbolic
link from the installed plugin (e.g. /usr/lib64/purple-2/libchime.so) to
.libs/libchime.so in your working tree.


    ==============
    AUTHENTICATION
    ==============

Use the setup-pidgin.py script to obtain an authentication token.  The
script will automatically update the accounts configuration by adding
the token, use the "-n" option if you want to add it by hand.  For more
information use the "-h" option.

Alternatively, initial authentication to Chime is performed via a web
browser. Start at https://signin.id.ue1.app.chime.aws/ and complete the
authentication process until you end up at a URI that the browser cannot
handle, which looks something like

      chime://sso_sessions?Token=eyJyZâ€¦

The part after 'Token=' is your authentication token. Create an account
in Pidgin, select 'Amazon Chime' as the protocol in the 'Basic' tab then
go to the 'Advanced' tab and paste the token in the 'Token' field. Leave
the 'Signin URL' field empty.


    =========
    DEBUGGING
    =========

Run from a terminal with the CHIME_DEBUG environment variable set.
