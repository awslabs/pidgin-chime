We have a minimally functional client which can do chat rooms and 1:1 IM.
The code is at "prototype" quality and needs improving, and there are
features and corner cases which are still unhandled. What se need to do
includes...


 • Error handling

   There is very little of this; a lot of silent "return" on failures.
   That's all very well for a rapid prototype but crap for a piece of
   software that people are actually going to use. Someone needs to do
   the fun part of turning all those failures into coherent error
   messages.


 • Logging

   Somewhat ties into the above. We should emit decent application
   logs through purple_debug(), in addition to dumping the wire
   traffic as we do when $CHIME_DEBUG is set. We should ensure we
   log unhandled incoming messages — the juggernaut callback already
   has a start at returning a 'handled' status.


 • Multi-party conversations

   These will need to be represented as chats in Pidgin.


 • Message notifications / attachments

   Handle the special cases in messages other than just plain text.


 • IM history

   Work out how we can make historical IM messages available without
   having to present then *all* as new messages on first startup.


 • Presence / availability

   Investigate and properly implement the device availability workflow,
   use the 'Automatic' status instead of 'Available', and ensure we
   have coverage of the other states that a peer can be in.


 • Login

   Work out if there's a way we can actually handling the login from
   within Pidgin.


 • Pidgin 3.x

   Port to Pidgin 3.x


 • 'Typing' status

   Send and show the 'is typing a message...' status


 • Message receipts

   As of Pidgin 3.x we can show when a message has been read:

 • Valgrind testing

   Keep running under 'valgrind --leak-check=full' and other testing


 • Voice / video / meetings

   Lots more fun here when we're ready...
