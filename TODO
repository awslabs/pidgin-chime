 • CHAT ROOMS / IM

   The chat functionality is fairly complete, but some parts are
   exposed rather clumsily or not at all due to the limitations of the
   Pidgin/libpurple APIs. The good news is that when we publish this
   plugin as open source, we can improve those APIs to expose our
   functionality in a saner way. Things we don't support yet for this
   reason — but which we *could* expose somehow in the meantime if
   there is demand for it — include:

   • Removing chat room members.
   • Deleting / administration of / leaving chat rooms.
   • Notification settings for IM/chat (always/mention/never).
   • Displaying full name of users who are not "buddies".
   • List of chat rooms with unread message counts, especially in the
     buddy list.
   • Creating new group chats (not rooms).

   Other TODO items which are less constrained by the Pidgin APIs:

   • Automatically populate buddy list with chat rooms, as we do for
     contacts.

   • Markdown support: this works for incoming but you have to
     explicitly type "/md ... " in your outbound messages to send it.
     This is the same as the web client but we should do better and
     convert from HTML generated by Pidgin's UI editor/formatter.


 • FILE TRANSFER

 • We support receiving photo attachments, but complete support for
   sending/receiving arbitrary attachments is being worked on in a
   Github PR.


 • MEETINGS

   Basic meeting handling is functional — we can schedule meetings and
   join them, and the participant list is displayed.

   • Audio

     This is now basically working, but needs cleanup. In particular
     the transport code needs to be properly implemented so that it
     can handle reconnects, and use DTLS in preference to the TCP
     websocket.

   • Screen share

     Implementing screen share RX and representing it as an incoming
     video stream in Pidgin should be relatively simple. Outbound also
     shouldn't be so hard, based on libshadow and the code in the Lync
     plugin.

   • Video

     Video is mostly RTP-based, so should be a lot easier to throw
     together than audio was.


 • DIRECT MEDIA CALLS

   The Chime app gives you a way to make audio/video calls directly to
   individuals. We can currently receive those calls, since they
   basically show up as meetings. We need to work out the protocol
   API which set up such a 1:1 call, and implement them so that you
   can make an audio/video call directly to an IM contact.


 • PRESENCE / AVAILABILITY

   Investigate and properly implement the device availability workflow,
   use the 'Automatic' status instead of 'Available', and ensure we
   have coverage of the other states that a peer can be in.


 • PIDGIN 3.x
